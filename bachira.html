<p class="brainrot"><i>Meguru Bachira is an eccentric and instinctive forward in Blue Lock, known for his exceptional dribbling skills and playful personality. He plays for Spain's FC Barcha in the Neo Egoist League. Bachira initially joined Blue Lock to find players who share his passion and have a similar "monster" within, a metaphorical representation of his innate footballing drive. He is known for his signature style of play, which emphasizes his dribbling ability to weave through opponents with a combination of speed and technique. Bachira's growth throughout the series involves him moving past his childhood trauma related to being ostracized for his unique style and fully embracing his egoistic playstyle, determined to become the best striker in the world. He develops impressive skills like the Hyperspeed Scissors and Midair Elastico, showcasing his creativity and technical prowess on the field. Bachira's rankings within Blue Lock have varied, but he was ranked 265th after the dormitory test and reached 16th place during the Second Selection.
